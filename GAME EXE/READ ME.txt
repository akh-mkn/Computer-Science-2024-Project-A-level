Welcome to my game:

- You are taking the role of an interrogator. 
- There will be 3 levels featuring 3 unique suspects for you to try and incriminate.
- Within each level there are 5 questions, and for each question there are three options you can select from.

Select questions using the 1,2,3 number keys.

Be careful... each question has a different ranking and will affect the hot bar on the side of the screen:
One of the three questions is ranked as excellent and will fill the hot bar. 
One is ranked as neutral, and will have no effect on the hot bar. 
And finally... one of the questions is ranked as poor and will decrease the hot bar progress.


IF the hot bar fills up completely, you have won the level.
IF the hot bar decreases completely, you have definetely lost. 
IF the hot bar has NOT filled completely by the end of the level, you have lost.



** Music and SFX settings can be toggled on and off at the start of the game. **



Good luck, you will need it.
